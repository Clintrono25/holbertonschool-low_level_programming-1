# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Resources
* [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
* [Space complexity (1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

## Requirements
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, â€¦ is forbidden.
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search_algos.h`
* All your header files should be include guarded

## More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
* `O(1)`
* `O(n)`
* `O(n!)`
* n*m -> `O(nm)`
* n square -> `O(n^2)`
* sqrt n -> `O(sqrt(n))`
* og(n) -> `O(log(n))`
* n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
